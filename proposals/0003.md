# Summary

The decision here is to implement our software under the license of
GPLv3+linking exception. This also means that outside contributors must sign off
on their commits to our software, as described by our Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

# Explanation

Most of the explanation of why we are doing this is recorded in the
`radicle.community` links above. What this means is that all repositories under
`radicle-dev` must comply with the following sections.

# Recommendation

In this section we include the templates that need to be included and also other
recommendations to make the licensing experience as smooth as possible for both
contributors and core developers.

## License File

Every repository MUST include a `LICENSE` file which corresponds to this
[file][license-file].

## DCO File

Every repository MUST include a `DCO` which corresponds to this
[file][dco-file].


## CONTRIBUTING File

Every repository MUST include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. The
inclusion of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file will mean that GitHub will prompt new
contributors to look at the file before making a pull request.

The file must include the following section:

```
## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project, you agree to the [Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO)](./path/to/DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution.

In order to show your agreement with the DCO you should include at the end of the commit message,
the following line: Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>, using your real name and email.

This can be done easily using the -s flag on the git commit.

If you find yourself pushed a few commits without Signed-off-by, you can still add it afterwards.
```

# Open Questions

* Should we include a PR template, or do we leave this up to the first time
  contribution bot?
* Can we disable the merge button on GitHub?
* Should we add a document on how to fix non-signed commits?
  [This](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/developer-community/fix-DCO.md) seems very
  good so maybe we can adopt a similar document.
