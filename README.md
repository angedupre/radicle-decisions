# radicle-decisions

**Radicle Developers of All Countries, Unite!**

## What is this?

`radicle-decisions` is the home for our proposed decisions that have been scrutinised by our team of developers.
_Accepted decisions_ are expected to be ahered to and practised throughout the `radicle-dev` organisation.
_Rejected decisions_ will be be left as a trace to what we have proposed and why it was ultimately rejected.
